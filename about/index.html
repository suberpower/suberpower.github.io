I wish you a lot of pleasure reading and hope you  would learn a thing or two while doing so.">

    <p>In my transformation to become a reputable Security Engineer I will come across a lot of interesting tech topics to share. I&rsquo;ll start off writing about using Linux as main OS for home computing, with some guides and reviews. Cloud and Security topics are being prepared to add sparkles to this techblog. Oh, and in case you&rsquo;re wondering: Yes, I accept donations for coffee (for writing in the late hours). &lt;3</p>
<h2 id="hardware-i-use">Hardware I use</h2>
<p>When my peers see my stuff they wonder how my keyboard cost more than my laptop. And
how I would love an Apple Magic Trackpad while avoiding Apple iCloud.</p>
<h3 id="laptops">Laptops</h3>
<p>My main laptop is a ThinkPad X230, released in 2012. I bought mine secondhand via a local classified
advertisement website, and it included the ThinkPad Ultrabase, which I use at home daily for
working at the desk. Old ThinkPads are designed for long term corporate use and lasts forever
due to the inner roll cage.</p>
<p>The secundary laptop is a GPD Pocket 2, released in 2018. I received this as a test device for my
participation in GPD Linux configuration and driver development project (Shenzhen) and have kept it ever since. This laptop is cute (7&rdquo; display) until you hook it up on a monitor. This Pocketmonster is great for on the go.</p>
<h3 id="network-monitor">Network Monitor</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve setup an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) to monitor network traffic at home. In my
attempt to master Network Security, I&rsquo;ve deployed my IDS at an old Thinkpad (X61). I&rsquo;m thinking
about to replace it for more computing power as the IDS tends to hog the CPU.</p>
<h3 id="keyboards">Keyboards</h3>
<p>How would my keyboard cost more than my laptop, you wonder? While the average &ldquo;Keyboard and
Mouse&rdquo; setup cost around 20-30 Euros, I tend to spend a fortune on these things. My keyboard at
desk is a custom NIZ Micro 82 EC-Ble. It&rsquo;s an electro capacitive keyboard with custom BKE Redux
at 45 grams and custom SA high profile keycaps. I do computing work 12 hours a day on average. As I do, I lay my fingers on these devices and aspire to compute at the highest level of comfort as possible. Or maybe i&rsquo;m just a geek. Or not maybe, I just am.</p>
<p>I think the sweetspot of keyboard layouts is at 75%. The loss of numpad makes up for space and I find it easier to align my body posture to the computer screen. I use a custom calculator (with MX cherry blue keyswitches) for touchtyping in digits via Bluetooth.</p>
<h3 id="pointing-devices">Pointing Devices</h3>
<p>Apple Magic Trackpad (2) above any other pointing device, period. After all these years, I
still can&rsquo;t get my hands around a mouse (pun intended). It forces my arm in a very unnatural
position as I feel my arm and neck complaining. This is why I find the trackpad awesome:
precision and gestures. I&rsquo;m nowhere slower and the gestures adds a new dimension to desktop and
browser control.</p>
<p>I used to use a Logitech MX Anywhere lasermouse for gaming but unfortunately haven&rsquo;t found time to do desktop
gaming lately.</p>
<h2 id="software-i-use">Software I use</h2>
<p>These are the programs for my computing needs. The listed programs are used for a while and considered as
tried and true, there is no other (my favourites).</p>
<h3 id="operating-system">Operating system</h3>
<p>I use Linux Void, an independent distribution developed entirely by volunteers. Unlike most
other distros, Void is not a modification of an existing distribution. It&rsquo;s package manager and
build system have been written from scratch. If you happen to feel like distrohopping and want to try out one without systemd and glibc, than take this green pill. I&rsquo;ve hopped on this distro since 2018 and never
looked back.</p>
<h3 id="shell">Shell</h3>
<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been using zsh instead of bash. For it&rsquo;s recursive path expansion, &ldquo;/u/lo/b&rdquo; expands to &ldquo;/usr/local/bin&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s basically the bash for modern days with extension plug-ins.</p>
<h3 id="terminal">Terminal</h3>
<p>URxvt (rxvt-unicode) is a fork of rxvt. I use this because it&rsquo;s fast, lean and fairly customizable. I&rsquo;ve spent time on the newer GPU-powered terminals like Alacritty and Hyper but this unique feature of URxvt draws me back everytime: it can run as a daemon to save memory output.</p>
<h3 id="window-manager-desktop-environment">Window Manager (Desktop Environment)</h3>
<p>I have no Desktop Manager (KDE/GNOME etc&hellip;) but use a Window Manager like i3-gaps instead. This
makes me able to control my windows with keyboard only. My windows, wether I want them
full-screen or split-screen, are just a few keystrokes away.</p>
<p>My taskbar is based on polybar. It&rsquo;s shows date and time, battery, volume, wifi, bluetooth,
is easy extensible and configurable.</p>
<h3 id="text-editing-and-programming">Text editing and programming</h3>
<p>I use two text editors: vim and OSS code. I mainly use vim vanilla but for projects I prefer OSS
code for it&rsquo;s plug-in library.</p>
<h3 id="web-browser">Web Browser</h3>
<p>Firefox is a safer standard browser. It blocks cryptomining scripts and social trackers.
Chromium as secundary. If
it wasn&rsquo;t for it&rsquo;s page translation feature, I would have not been using Chromium alongside.</p>
<h3 id="file-manager">File Manager</h3>
<p>I manage my files in the terminal with ranger. Very customizable and efficient, it has vim-like console and
hotkeys.</p>
<p>I do use a file manager with GUI for drag and drop stuff: Nemo. Just for it&rsquo;s looks.</p>
<h3 id="mail-client">Mail Client</h3>
<p>Nowadays rich e-mail is the norm. Mutt takes e-mail back to it&rsquo;s essentials, no text
formatting and no images. It&rsquo;s good for scripting, to automate sending e-mails. I use this for
sending e-mailalerts from my IDS.</p>
<h3 id="rss-reader">RSS Reader</h3>
<p>Newsboat. The internet has been blown up by all bells and whistle. It&rsquo;s better to
keep up with the internet through RSS to skip all cookies and ads. Bonus: I browse Youtube
channels through RSS and watch videos without having to open a browser.</p>
<h3 id="spreadsheet">Spreadsheet</h3>
<p>Spreadsheets can be done in the terminal with sc-im. I&rsquo;m taught to use Excel but all the basic things I do in Excel can be done in sc-im.</p>
<h3 id="pdf-viewer">PDF Viewer</h3>
<p>Zathura opens PDF files instantly. I also use it as a preview window for writing in Markdown.
It&rsquo;s cool to write in Markdown, it&rsquo;s portable and it&rsquo;s format is easily converted into a webpage,
Word document or yes&hellip; a PDF file.</p>
<h3 id="image-modification">Image modification</h3>
<p>GIMP. Although I do all my graphic works on a Mac (Photoshop CS), GIMP comes close. GIMP does
mostly everything Photoshop does for my use and with Photoshop keyboard shortcuts in GIMP, the
transition is negligible.</p>
